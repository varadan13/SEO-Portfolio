## What was done?

Leveraging Semrush, I conducted thorough keyword research to identify the most relevant and high-performing keywords for our website. Integrating these keywords strategically, I optimized the title, description, headings, and content to enhance search engine visibility and improve overall SEO performance. In parallel, I employed ImageMagick command-line tools to efficiently resize and format images, ensuring optimal display and faster loading times. To enhance website performance, I meticulously minified all static resources, including CSS and JS files within the public folder, streamlining the site's codebase.

In addition, I implemented crucial on-page SEO elements by incorporating social media meta tags and canonical meta tags. This step not only enhances the site's presentation on social platforms but also provides search engines with valuable information about content relevance and structure. 

Backlinking was not done.

## Result

The aforementioned websites appeared as top results, i.e., on the first page of Google for most of the targeted keywords.
